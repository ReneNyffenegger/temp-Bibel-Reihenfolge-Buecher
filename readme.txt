   The order of books is usual for the Greek manuscripts: Acts, Catholic epistles, and Pauline epistles.

   The order of these divisions is fairly standardized.
   The gospels are almost always the first thing in a codex
     (and at least some of the exceptions are the result of rebinding).
   Acts and Catholic Epistles generally precede Paul, though this is not universal.
   The Apocalypse is generally last.


   For the order of books within the four sections, there is rather more variety.
   The most notable case of a "movable book" Hebrews, found at various places within the Pauline corpus.
   Usually it follows either 2 Thessalonians or Philemon, but it has occurred in many other places (as it followed Galatians in the ancestor of Vaticanus).
   The order of some of the other shorter books also varies, e.g. Philippians may swap with Colossians.
   The first four books (Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians) almost always occur in that order.
   Other variations might possibly be scribal -- e.g. a scribe finished Ephesians, quit for the day, and accidentally copied Colossians next rather than Philippians,
   then went back and copied the other.
   There is no proof of this happening, but it is much more likely in Paul than any other section.

   The Gospels almost always occur in the order
      Matthew-Mark-Luke-John.
   But there are exceptions, and most of them are early.
   The most common variation on this order is the so-called "Western" order,
      found in D, W, and probably P45:
        Matthew, John, Luke, Mark.

   The Catholic Epistles probably show the most variation, especially in early
   manuscripts, since some of the books (James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude)
   were of questionable canonicity.
      The Peshitta, for instance, includes only James, 1 Peter, and 1 John.
      It will be evident that the order of the books will be dependent upon which books are included.
