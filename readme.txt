   The order of books is usual for the Greek manuscripts: Acts, Catholic epistles, and Pauline epistles.

   The order of these divisions is fairly standardized.
   The gospels are almost always the first thing in a codex
     (and at least some of the exceptions are the result of rebinding).
   Acts and Catholic Epistles generally precede Paul, though this is not universal.
   The Apocalypse is generally last.
